# Merge-commits-messages ðŸ“Ÿ

Jira and github has a deployment integration so that when using GitHub action
to deploy code, the relevant Jira story get's updated according to the relevant environment.
To do this, the commits message/ branch name/ Pr description must contain the Jira story Id.
However, when creating a PR from `staging` branch to `production` branch for example. the Jira ticket loss
context, and you'll have to manually update the PR description with the relevant Story ID.

This is where *Merge-commits-messages* action comes in.
